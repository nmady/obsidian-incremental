## Obsidian Multi-line Formatting Plugin 

This plugin is designed to offer formatting over an entire selection, even if that selection has paragraph breaks in the middle! 

## Usage

Choose the formatting you want to apply in Settings. The default is HTML highlighting (using span tags), since sometimes one colour just won't cut it.

Select the text you want to format, and use the command **Format, even over multiple lines**

## Bug reports and feature requests welcome!

Please let me know how this plugin can be improved.
