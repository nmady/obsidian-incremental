## Obsidian Multi-line Formatting Plugin 

This plugin is designed to offer formatting over an entire selection, even if that selection has paragraph breaks in the middle! 

## Usage

Choose the formatting you want to apply in Settings. The default is HTML highlighting (using span tags), since sometimes one colour just won't cut it.

Select the text you want to format, and use the command **Format, even over multiple lines**

## Limitations

This plugin was designed for formatting multiple lines of plain text. It will not play nicely with headings, lists, blockquotes, codeblocks, etc. Perhaps in the future it will, but for now, if you try to use it over other forms of markdown formatting, you will likely have to do some repair-work to move the formatting symbols to the correct places.

## Bug reports and feature requests welcome!

Please let me know how this plugin can be improved.
