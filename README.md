## Obsidian Multi-line Formatting Plugin 

This plugin is designed to offer formatting over an entire selection, even if that selection has paragraph breaks in the middle! 

## Usage

Choose the formatting you want to apply in Settings. The default is HTML highlighting (using span tags), since sometimes one colour just won't cut it.

Select the text you want to format, and use the command **Format, even over multiple lines**. Be careful not to start or end your selection in the middle of another type of paired formatting (e.g. bold, italics, highlighting, etc.)

## Limitations

This plugin should work for paragraphs. Default settings skip over headings and list items, but you can toggle off **Skip Headings** and **Skip List Items** in Settings. However, be aware that code blocks and blockquotes *in* list items are not formatted correctly. 

Blockquote formatting is a planned feature.

## Bug reports and feature requests appreciated!**

Please let me know how this plugin can be improved.
